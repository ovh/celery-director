# Write Tasks

Director is a wrapper around Celery, so creating tasks with it is *almost* the same
as creating tasks for pure Celery.

## Create a task

In pure Celery you had to create a Celery application object (`app = Celery(...)`) and use
the `app.task()` decorator to transform Python function into Celery tasks.

This work has already be done for you in Director, so you just have to transform your function
using the `director.task` decorator :

```python
# tasks/example.py
from director import task


@task(name="TASK_EXAMPLE")
def my_task(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
```

!!! warning Task naming
    The `name` parameter in the task decorator is mandatory. Because it will be used in the YAML
    file to [combine tasks into workflows](build-workflows.md), this name **must be unique**.

## Task signature

To simplify the tasks creation, and to allow multiple workflows to reuse the same task, their
signature is always the same : `(*args, **kwargs)`.

The **kwargs** dictionnary can be used to [handle the payload](use-payload.md#handle-payload)
while **args** contains the results of the task parents (of course args is empty if your task
is at the beginning of a workflow).

!!! info "Technical explanation"
    In Celery the developer can decide if a task is able to received the result of its parents or
    not with 2 methods : **s()** and **si()**. The *i* means **immutability** and
    is intended to ignore the parents results. So normally, as a developer, you
    have to be carefull about the method to used and you also have to create your tasks signatures
    consequently.

    But Director has been created to simplify that ! As we decided to received the results of the
    parents in the `args` parameter we always use the `s()` method.

Here is are some concrete examples based on the following tasks :

```python
# tasks/example.py
from director import task

@task(name="A")
def a(*args, **kwargs):
    return {"result": "a_data"}

@task(name="B")
def b(*args, **kwargs):
    return {"result": "b_data"}

@task(name="C")
def c(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args)
```

The following workflows present different usecases and the output of the C task (see the
[Build Workflows](build-workflows.md) guide to understand the YAML format) :

```yaml
example.NO_PARENT:
  tasks:
    - C
# Result : (None,)

example.ONE_PARENT:
  tasks:
    - A
    - B
    - C
# Result : ({'result': 'b_data'},)

example.MULTIPLE_PARENT:
  tasks:
    - GROUP_1:
        type: group
        tasks:
          - A
          - B
    - C
# Result : ([{'result': 'a_data'}, {'result': 'b_data'}],)
```

## Bound Tasks

Celery allows use to [bind a task](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/tasks.html#bound-tasks),
providing the task instance itself as the first parameter.

In this case the signature will must contain a first parameter just before args and kwargs :

```python
# tasks/example.py
from director import task

@task(bind=True, name="BOUND_TASK")
def bound_task(self, *args, **kwargs):
    print(self.name)
```

## Celery Task Options

The `task()` decorator provided by Director is just a wrapper of the native `app.task()` decorator
provided by Celery, so all the [original options](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/tasks.html#list-of-options) are still available.

You can for example apply a *rate_limit* or even configure the max number of retries.
